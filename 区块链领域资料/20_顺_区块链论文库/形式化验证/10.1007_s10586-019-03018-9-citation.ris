AB  - Today, cloud providers represent their individual services with several functional and non-functional properties in various environments. Discovering and selecting an appropriate atomic service from a pool of activated services are a main challenge in the multi-cloud service composition. Minimizing the number of cloud providers is a critical matter in the service composition problem, which effects on energy consumption, response time and total cost. This paper presents a hybrid formal verification approach to assess the service composition in multi-cloud environments though the decreasing number of cloud providers to gain final service composition with a high level of Quality of Service (QoS). The presented approach provides behavioral modeling to examine the procedure of userâ€™ requests, service selection, and composition in a multi-cloud environment. Also, the proposed approach permits analysis of the service composition using a Multi-Labeled Transition Systems (MLTS)-based model checking and Pi-Calculus-based process algebra methods for monitoring the functional specifications and non-functional properties as the QoS standards. In addition, the proposed approach satisfies the functional properties for the multi-cloud service composition. The experimental results proved the feasibility of the proposed approach with performance evaluations and some confirmation setups.
